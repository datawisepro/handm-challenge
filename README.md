# H&M Recommendation Challenge

Description

For this challenge you are given the purchase history of customers across time, along with supporting metadata. Your challenge is to predict what articles each customer will purchase in the 7-day period immediately after the training data ends. Customers who did not make any purchase during that time are excluded from the scoring.
